Attrition analysis challenge
1. Attrition data is imbalanced, the classification report should be used in place of accuracy. 
2. Softmax is best for the department output because department has three possible values; while sigmoid is best for attrition due to it's ability to work with binary numbers.
3. Analised and tried different features to see is they impact the models. And finetuning models with different nubmers of neurons and layers.
